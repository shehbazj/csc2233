# CSC2233 - Project 2 - Designing a NVMe based File System

**Pre-requisites**

- Undergraduate OS course CSC369/ECE344 or equivalent - experience with OS161/ext2 file system.
- Excellent understanding of file system internals.
- Prior experience reading, understanding and making changes to a large codebase (1000+ lines of code).
- Ability to work independently with minimal instructor/TA supervision.

# Background

In the past 5 years, storage systems have evolved and become much faster. Storage devices can now be accessed in parallel using the [NVMe protocol](https://nvmexpress.org/). File-systems and applications have to be re-written to take advantage of the parallelism exposed by the NVMe device.
One way to do so is to use the [SPDK library](https://spdk.io/) that provides us a userspace lockless, polled and parallel interface to the underlying storage device. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOpZbzupt9M) is an interesting video summarising the changes to be made in the filesystem or applications.

# Objective

The goal of the project is to explore the NVMe protocol and make changes in a simple, userspace file system  called [testFS](https://github.com/shehbazj/testfs) to write to an NVMe device. First, you will spend time understanding [NVMe protocol](https://nvmexpress.org/), the [SPDK library](https://spdk.io/) and the testFS file system. You can divide your work into two parts - one project partner can understand testFS and the other project partner can understand NVMe and SPDK. Next, you will make changes to testFS file system such that the writes from the testFS file system can be directed to specific NVMe namespace. Refer NVMe specifications for more details.

# Checkpoint 1 Mid Term Checkpoint (Feb 28th)
- Understand NVMe protocol.
- Install SPDK and run the [hello_world](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/blob/master/examples/nvme/hello_world/hello_world.c) program on a VM with NVMe device. Instructions can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/accelerating-your-nvme-drives-with-spdk). You can use [vagrant](https://spdk.io/doc/vagrant.html) to work on a VM.
- Read and understand the testFS file system.
- Identify different data structures of the testFS file system - superblock, data blocks, inodes, bitmaps and so on.
- Familiarize yourself with testFS/block.c file and its functions, and the functions that call these functions. You will be making changes to the functions here.
- Make changes in block.c so that you can serially write and read data to the NVMe device. Follow hello_world example as a guideline. Instead of the string "hello world" you will be writing and reading data that is sent by the user /dd / fio application.

# Checkpoint 2 End Term Checkpoint (March 31st)
- direct writes for a specific data structure block to a specific NVMe namespace. eg. we want all inode blocks of testFS to be written to 1 Namespace of the NVMe SSD, and all data blocks to be written to another Namespace.
- Compare the performance of original testFS file with your implementation and report the speed gain. You can use dd or fio to benchmark your testFS implementation.

# Checkpoint 3 Final Report

## Main Report (Latex + pdf)
1. A pdf document describing your understanding of NVMe protocol and testFS file system. The changes that you had to make in testFS file system, and the gain in performance by redirecting different data structures to different namespaces.

## Code
2. The testFS code as a tarball file.

## Reference
1. You are free to check and borrow ideas from NVFUSE file system which is available on [github](https://github.com/nvfuse/nvfuse)
