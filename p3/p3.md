# CSC2233 - Project 3 - Implementing a Machine Learning based Cache Management Policy

**Pre-requisites**

- Undergraduate course in Machine Learning - CSC411 or equivalent.
- Good understanding of Supervised and Unsupervised learning. Familiarity with reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Hands-on experience with numpy, sklearn libraries.
- A good understanding of existing [caching algorithms](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vm-beyondphys-policy.pdf).

# Background

Enterprise data centers often use two types of storage devices - fast, small and expensive media like RAM, NVRAM and slower, high-capacity, inexpensive media like HDD and SSD. Data can be stored in both the media, however the goal is to serve maximum amount of requests directly from the fast media, without going to the slower media. Hence data needs to often be fetched from slower media and evicted from the faster media. The faster media is called Cache. A number of algorithms have been proposed to manage cache eviction - i.e. determining what data should be removed from the cache to store new data. This involves predicting next data blocks that would be fetched and which ones can be evicted, given the block features of the current blocks in cache. The ratio of number of block requests served directly from the faster media to the number of blocks served from the slower media is called the hit-rate.

# Objective

The goal of this project is to use real-world blocktraces and create ML algorithms to perform prefetch and eviction of blocks. We will give you a starter code containing the basic implementation of LRU, LFU and OPT algorithm. Feel free to reimplement these algorithms on your own. You will use different block features that are captured in blocktrace to predict which blocks should be evicted from the cache. You can use OPT algorithm to train your ML Model (for supervised learning) for eviction.

# Checkpoint 1 Mid Term Checkpoint (Feb 28th)
- Familiarise yourself with the starter code and OPT algorithm.
- Implement logistic regression and compare it with LFU and LRU algorithm for 5-10 traces.
- Implement 1 other supervised learning algorithm and compare it with LFU and LRU algorithm.
- Finalize on implementing any two of the following algorithms for your final report:
1. Adaptive Replacement Cache.
2. Multi-Arm Bandit.
3. LeCAR.
4. Neural Network.
5. Any other reinforcement/online learning algorithm.

# Checkpoint 2 End Term Checkpoint (March 31st)
- Evaulate your algorithm against LRU and LFU algorithm.
- Vary the following parameters and report the hit-rate:
1. Effect of cache size. 
2. Effect of test/train split.
3. Any other interesting metric.

# Checkpoint 3 Final Report
1. A pdf format report (we will release a template soon) describing the results.
2. Code - either a .py or a jupyter notebook file with comments.
